# Facial Recognition-Based Passwordless Sign-On
This project demonstrates the implementation of a facial recognition authentication system that serves as a passwordless sign-on solution. It is based on research around modern identity management systems such as Okta, which enables secure and seamless login experiences without the need for traditional passwords.

# Overview
With the increasing concern over security breaches and password fatigue, passwordless authentication methods are gaining traction as the future of secure and frictionless login experiences. Okta, a leading identity and access management (IAM) platform, is at the forefront of adopting and implementing passwordless authentication, allowing organizations to provide a secure, user-friendly sign-on process.

This project is a proof of concept for building a facial recognition system as a passwordless alternative for login. It leverages computer vision techniques, along with face detection and recognition models, to identify users based on their facial features, enabling a sign-on mechanism that is both secure and convenient.

The system captures the user's face through a webcam, compares it with pre-registered facial data, and grants access based on a successful match, eliminating the need for passwords.

# Features
Real-time facial recognition: Captures the user's face through a webcam and processes it in real-time.

Cross-platform: Built using Python and OpenCV, this system can be easily adapted for different environments.

# Research Background
Passwordless Authentication
Passwordless authentication eliminates the need for traditional passwords, which are prone to weaknesses such as reuse, phishing, and brute-force attacks. With passwordless methods, users authenticate through biometrics, hardware tokens, or email-based magic links.

In this context, facial recognition is an attractive choice for passwordless authentication because of its convenience, speed, and security. Biometrics like facial recognition can reduce the risk of password-related attacks and improve user experience by allowing quick and secure sign-ins.

# Okta and Passwordless Authentication
Okta, one of the leading identity management platforms, has been actively working on integrating passwordless authentication into enterprise environments. Oktaâ€™s Adaptive Authentication platform enables organizations to transition to passwordless systems, relying on multiple factors like biometrics, behavior analytics, and device-based security to verify the identity of users.

Okta's passwordless sign-on features include:

Biometric sign-in: Uses face or fingerprint recognition to verify the user's identity without requiring a password.

Device-based authentication: Leverages devices such as smartphones or laptops with trusted certificates to authenticate users.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Combines multiple factors (e.g., face recognition + PIN) for additional security.

Okta's implementation of passwordless authentication is particularly relevant for organizations looking to improve security and user experience by eliminating passwords, which can be vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, credential stuffing, and brute force.

# Advantages of Passwordless Sign-On
Enhanced Security: Passwordless methods, especially biometrics like facial recognition, significantly reduce the attack surface by eliminating passwords, which can be stolen or hacked.

Reduced Friction: Users no longer need to remember complex passwords, which can be cumbersome. This leads to a more streamlined user experience.

Improved User Experience: Passwordless systems provide a seamless sign-on experience, allowing users to authenticate quickly and easily using their face or fingerprint.

Decreased Support Costs: Since there are fewer password-related issues (forgotten passwords, password resets), organizations can reduce the costs associated with help desks and account recovery processes.

# Facial Recognition Technology
Facial recognition technology is based on biometric identification, which uses distinctive facial features (such as the distance between eyes, nose, and mouth) to identify individuals. It can be categorized into 2D face recognition (using a single image) and 3D face recognition (which maps the face in 3D for more accurate results). For this project, we use 2D face recognition via OpenCV and machine learning models.

Common algorithms for facial recognition include:

Eigenfaces: This method uses principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of face images and recognize them.

Fisherfaces: An improved method over eigenfaces, using linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

Deep Learning Approaches: More modern systems rely on neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in face recognition.
